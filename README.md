# parcel-plugin-sucrase

In preparation for Parcel v2 moving to more of a plugin style and dropping Babel as a dependancy we have opted to use Sucrase for our Babel replacement due to speed. Parcel V2 is currently out in @next. This is a non-official transformer plugin. Any help or suggestions are greatly appreciated.
